    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>
      We put forth the following rights with the aim of ensuring property 
      protection and social well-being in the digital world. Property in the 
      digital world is the data or “digital exhaust” one produces from using these 
      technologies. The right to said property extends from existing frameworks of 
      property rights. There are numerous difficulties associated with generating 
      sustainable & effective digital property rights. Questions surrounding privacy, 
      access to knowledge, etc. shape the way we think about property rights. With the 
      following rights, we do not aim to answer these questions/resolve these debates. 
      Rather, we aspire for these rights to serve as a blueprint for property protection 
      in the digital world, with the hope that these rights are shaped and contextualized 
      according to the situations within which they must be exercised.

    <h2>Rights</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
       <li>The right to data as a <a href="https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/johnson2.pdf">property</a>.</li>
       <ol type="a">
         <li>Right to possession of one's data.</li>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Individuals shall have the right to an expiration date for their data when held by a third party.</li>
            <li>Individuals shall have the right to protection of their data insofar as this protection does not 1) prevent others from enjoying scientific or cultural progress or 2) <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-cultural-rights/impact-intellectual-property-regimes-enjoyment-right-science-and-culture">actively harm</a> other members of society.</li>
          </ol>
         <li>Right to manage one's data.</li>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Individuals shall have the right to know how one's data will be used.</li>
            <li>Individuals' data shall be utilized by third-parties only with the aim of benefiting either the individual or society writ large. Data shall not be utilized for exploitation.</li>
          </ol>
         <li>Right to income of one's data.</li>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Individuals shall have the right to not have their data utilized for third-party monetary value extraction. In effect, individuals shall have the right to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364921001096?via%3Dihub">non-discrimination</a> on any potential vector of discrimination arising from their data.</li>

    <h2>For Further Consideration</h2>
    <p>
      Based on these rights, we encourage corporations to recognize the importance of having collective ownership over data. 
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy">Surveillance Capitalism</a> is a relatively recent phenomenon that has 
      largely operated without regulation. Just because a few dominant surveillance capitalists have controlled the digital landscape does not mean they can continue to reap the benefits of our 
      digital participation and existence. Existing initiatives such as the <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/ideas/articles/a-data-dividend-that-works-steps-toward-building-an-equitable-data-economy/">Data Dividend</a> 
      can lay the groundwork for thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW7k_GZYLwk">data as having collective value</a> and beneficial when reinvested back into society. After all, the global data economy cannot exist without the data-generating public.
